This application was made as a part of the curriculum over at The Odin Project.
For this assignment, I created a small and simple application that lets users submit posts that can be seen on the "Frontpage".
However, only other users can see the names for each post. For people who aren't signed in, it only shows the text and title, without the name of the poster.
